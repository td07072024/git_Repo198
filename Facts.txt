The saola (Pseudoryx nghetinhensis), also called spindlehorn, Asian unicorn, or infrequently, Vu Quang bovid, is a forest-dwelling bovid native to the Annamite Range in Vietnam and Laos. It was described in 1993 following a discovery of remains in Vũ Quang National Park by a joint survey of the Vietnamese Ministry of Forestry and the World Wide Fund for Nature.[2][3][4] Saolas have since been kept in captivity multiple times, although only for short periods as they died within a matter of weeks to months.[5] The first photograph of a living saola was taken in captivity in 1993. The most recent one was taken in 2013 by a movement-triggered camera in the forest of central Vietnam,[6] which represents the most recent record of the saola. There is concern that the species may already be extinct.[7] It is the only species in the genus Pseudoryx and the earliest diverging member of the tribe Bovini, placing buffalo and cattle as its closest relatives.
