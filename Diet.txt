Robichaud offered spleenwort (Asplenium), Homalomena, and various species of broad-leaved shrubs or trees of the family Sterculiaceae to the captive animal. The saola fed on all plants, and showed a preference for the Sterculiaceae species. She did not pull at leaves, she would rather chew or pull them into her mouth using her long tongue. She fed mainly during the day, and rarely in the dark.[16] The saola is also reputed to feed on Schismatoglottis, unlike other herbivores in its range.
