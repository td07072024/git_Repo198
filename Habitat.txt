The saola has one of the smallest ranges of any large mammal.[20] It inhabits wet evergreen or deciduous forests in eastern Southeast Asia, preferring river valleys. Sightings have been reported from steep river valleys at 300–1,800 m (980–5,910 ft) above sea level. In Vietnam and Laos, the species' range appears to cover approximately 5,000 km2 (1,900 sq mi), including four nature reserves. During the winters, it migrates to the lowlands.[21] In the northern Annamite Mountains, it was sighted mostly near streams at elevations of 592–1,112 m (1,942–3,648 ft).
